          <p class="card__text">In 1890, when the current Mississippi Constitution was drafted, legislators created a two-tiered process that has made it nearly impossible for a Black person to win statewide office.</p>

          <p class="card__text">The former Mississippi flag, adopted in 1894, contained the canton of the Confederate battle flag. From 2003 to 2020, Mississippi ws the only state with a flag that showcased this divisive symbol of the Confederacy. On June 28, 2020, the Legislature passed a bill to take down the old flag and establish a new symbol for Mississippi.</p>

      <p>Absentee ballots are available at your circuit clerk’s office and in-person absentee voting is available until October 31.</p>
      <p>This year, you may vote absentee if you have a medical condition that qualifies as a “physical disability” (e.g., serious asthma, diabetes, kidney diseases, and lupus) that puts you at greater risk of severe illness if you contract COVID-19 at your polling place. </p>
      <p>If you have health problems and worry that you could get very sick if you contracted COVID-19, contact your county circuit clerk and ask about voting absentee. </p>
      <p>You may also vote absentee if you have a directive from your personal doctor to “quarantine” at your home or are caring for someone who has such a directive.</p>
      <p>***Mississippi has expanded access to curbside voting for people with symptoms of COVID-19 including coughing, vomiting, headaches, fever, sore throat, congestion, or loss of taste or smell. If you experience these symptoms on Election Day, ask the poll manager to let you vote by curbside voting or open-air voting. Rule 2.8***</p>
